The DSF Board Elections have opened and voting is available for DSF members now until 27 November 2023 (Anywhere on Earth).

Here are some Amazing stats Regarding the DSF Election as they relate to Black Python Devs.

- 41% of the DSF Election Candidates are Black
- 33% of Candidates are in Black Python Devs
- 2 are in the Black Python Dev Leadership
- 1 is a Black Python Dev Member and leader in other Orgs and Roles

There are three seats open and I hope at least one can go to someone in this list of folks:
